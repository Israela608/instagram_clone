# instagram_clone

This project is a mobile app built using Flutter that replicates key features of Instagram and incorporates unique features, with state management implemented using Riverpod and backed by Firebase.

## Description

Welcome to my Instagram clone app! This is a mobile application built using Flutter, an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google.

The app aims to replicate some of the key features of Instagram, such as photo and video sharing, commenting and liking posts, and direct messaging.

In addition, the app also incorporates some unique features, including a search bar for exploring content and users, a user profile page to showcase individual posts and personal information, and a news feed to keep up with the latest posts and updates from followed accounts.

The app is backed by Firebase, a mobile and web application development platform, which provides a scalable and reliable backend infrastructure for storing and retrieving data.

The app's state management is implemented using Riverpod, a simple yet powerful state management system for Flutter. Riverpod helps manage the app's state and data flow in a declarative and efficient manner, making it easy to build and maintain complex user interfaces with minimal boilerplate code.

Through this project, I aim to showcase my skills in mobile app development using Flutter, as well as my ability to design and implement a user-friendly and engaging social media platform with the help of Firebase and Riverpod. Thank you for checking out my project!
